LEGAL AGREEMENTS AND DISCLAIMERS

SysRIP does not promote DDoS attacks, IP grabbing or any other illegal cyber activity. We may offer commands that claim to perform such actions. However, these are fake and are simply just for show. If you'd like a more detailed overview, please contact us.

SysRIP is determined to follow all laws provided by the UK Government. We cannot guarantee the respect of laws in other countries.

We are currently awaiting a response from the Police Advisory Board (PAB) to agree for TSoft to automatically deny any legal disputes from overseas territories.

If you do not agree with the legal terms, please do not use SysRIP.
