# The SMART program
## What does SMART mean?
SMART stands for:
- **S**topping
- **M**alware
- **A**nd
- **R**educing
- **T**hreats

## The backstory of SMART
SMART was created after the creator received malware on his computer from seemingly helpful software. SysRIP is a helpful and fun software to use, so SMART was created.

## What is SMART?
It's a program dedicated to help stop malware. While it may not have a very large impact, projects that follow SMART want to help put a stop to malware.

## How does SysRIP help and follow SMART?
SysRIP is open-source, you just have to download the files. You can review them in sandboxes, virus tests or just simply review the code if you know how to read Batch, PowerShell and Visual Basic.

## How do I know if a project is geniune and follows SMART?
You should check for the SMART label. If it's present, contact us and we'll run the checks.
